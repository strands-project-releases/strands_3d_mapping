ros-indigo-metaroom-xml-parser (0.0.10-0trusty) trusty; urgency=high

  * updated changelogs
  * Removed debug print
  * Added methods to load labelled data & example program
  * Added flag to indicate whether to load intermediate cloud (useful when looking only for the transform)
  * Fixed sweep sort (taking date into account
  * Sorting sweeps based on patrol number and room number
  * Also logging room run number (useful for reading objects  from mongo and saving them in the proper folder structure on the disk)
  * Returning the room log start time as part of the sweep structure
  * Returning the room log name as part of the sweep structure
  * Cleanup
  * debug statement cleanup
  * bigfix
  * Load orb features
  * Minor changes
  * Fixed include guard
  * Simple xml parser now reads corrected camera parameters and registered tranforms as well
  * Bugfix in loading all dynamic clusters at a particular waypoint
  * Bugfixes
  * Methods to parse and return dynamic cluster point clouds
  * SimpleXmlParser now parses and returns the dynamic clusters clouds, if it's been saved
  * utilities to get all the sweep xmls in a folder or for a particular waypoint
  * Removed debug prints
  * Safeguard against corrupted xmls
  * Removed test utilities main file
  * Simple summary parser now checks that found sweep xml files start with the correct element
  * Simple summary parser now parses any folder structure looking for sweep xml files (not just the semantic map standard folder structure - date/patrol_run_#/room_#/room.xml)
  * Added load_utilities.hpp and moved function implementations out of load_utilities.h
  * Commented out visualization of intermediate position images after parsing
  * Added routines for parsing intermediate sweep clouds and intermediate position images
  * Added / at the end of the folder path (more robust this way)
  * Added a vector of xml nodes that are to be parsed - this allows to load only particular fields (and thus point clouds or images) for sweeps. The fields covered are RoomCompleteCloud, RoomIntermediateCloud and IntermediatePosition
  * utilities to load all the merged point clouds from sweeps saved in some particular folder, and to load all the merged clouds for all the sweeps taken at some waypoint
  * Method to load the merged point cloud from a single sweep
  * Added verbose flag to the simple xml parser (default value false)
  * Removed unnecessary comments
  * Added load_utilities files - will contain higher level functions which will allow parsing local metric maps and returning various components
  * Renaming
  * Added explicit template instantiation for metaroom_xml_parser package
  * SimpleSummaryParser no longer templated
  * Bugfix
  * Printing intermediate image parameters
  * Loading intermediate room images, transforms and parameters

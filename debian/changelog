ros-hydro-cloud-merge (0.0.1-0precise) precise; urgency=high

  * Removed ability to process input point clouds. Using images to generate the point clouds
  * Logging intermediate data to the database disabled by default
  * Saving intermediate data enabled by default
  * removed input point cloud topic in the launch file. Not supported anymore as images are used as input directly
  * reorganized the code into additional methods
  * Some error checking
  * changes from upstream
  * Added image_transport as a dependency
  * Fixed qt_build and qt_ros dependencies
  * Removed package dependency on cloud_register
  * Removed unnecessary dependency on cloud_register
  * Fixed pcl dependency
  * Set up install targets for cloud_merge
  * removed unnecessary file
  * Changed qt dependency
  * Fixed license and maintainer email
  * Fixed mongodb dependency
  * Added dependency to message generation
  * First verison of mongodb dependency
  * merge from upstream
  * Renamed ros_datacentre to mongodb_store
  * Changed some methods to static
  * Added flag -mno-avx to tackle assembler errors during compiling on some new Intel core processors
  * Added launch file parameters for the table top voxel size, observation voxel size and a parameter for the point distance cutoff. Also added a parameter to specify whether to update the metarooms with new room observations
  * merged commit
  * Added another stream containing the downsampled observation point cloud and changed the size of the voxel grid to get smaller observation point clouds
  * Merge branch 'hydro-devel' of https://github.com/RaresAmbrus/scitos_3d_mapping into hydro-devel
  * Added services for waypoint based querying of observations, dynamic clusters and metarooms
  * Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/hydro-devel' into hydro-devel
    Conflicts:
    semantic_map/launch/mapping.launch
  * Changed the number of observations to 5
  * Added ftp upload action server to the launch file
  * respawn set to true
  * Launch parameter to cache or delete old data
  * Added function to move old data to a cache folder instead of deleting it
  * Handling preemption of the pan tilt sweep
  * Added a launch file parameter for saving to the database and fixed a bug.
  * Logging intermediate point clouds to the database. Logging dynamic clusters to the database
  * Handling the case when the observation point cloud is empty - should only happen if the camera isn't running
  * Automatically deducing the patrol run number and room id based on previously saved data
  * Added max number of instances per observation as a launch file parameters and made cleanup of the saved semantic map information false by default in the launch file
  * Added functionality to check how many instances of an observation have been saved, and remove some of them if there are too many
  * Changed types of launch file parameters to bool
  * Added launch file paremters to specify ros topics for input point cloud, input rgb image, input depth image and input camera info
  * Added launch file parameter generate_pointclouds for cloud_merge node specifying whether to use the RGBD images from the sensor to generate point clouds or whether to use the point clouds generate by the openni driver directly
  * Modification to use intermediate point clouds instead of generating them from RGBD images
  * Added ros-hydro-qt-build as a dependency in package.xml and updated the readme.
  * Added functionality to remove previously saved metric map data, which can be set via the launch parameter cleanup (yes/no). The default behavior atm is to delete previously saved data, i.e. all metarooms will be created from scratch. This does not affect the creation of individual room observations
  * Changed the voxel grid cell size to 1cm for downsampling the merged point cloud
  * Downsampling of observation point cloud using a 2cm voxel grid instead of 0.5 cm
  * Added launch file parameters for configuring the saving of intermediate data (would be used fro debugging purposes)
  * launch files
  * Local metric map nodes: cloud_merge - processing depth & rgb frames / point clouds and merging them into room observations; cloud_register - utilities for ICP and NDT point cloud registration; semantic_map - creating and managing the local metric map, updating the map with new room observations, extracting dynamic clusters, maintaining the XML structure on the disk.
